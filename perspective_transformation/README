Things to try:
    - check simple Interpolation. It seems that it doesn't even predict the points that it's
    - camera un-distort
    - use warpPerspective instead of perspective transform
    - projectPoints from one camera to 3D points; ditch a dimension and use the road as a camera plane (feed to findHomography the points on the road)
    - use fewer points (only corners)
    - findHomography simple SHOULD work (all the points on the road are on the same plane)
    - expand the image just to see where the rest of the points would be projected (y < 0)
